CS 52

The original website I based my site off of is https://sunbasket.com/. I felt like I captured the layout decently but there were a few things I was not able to figure out such as a CSS carousel and a sticky navbar, though not for lack of trying!
I found the HTML to be rather simple, though it changed a lot as I built up my CSS:

![HTML 1][images/html1]

![HTML 2][images/html2]
 
 (The screen caps are in the images folder labeled html 1 and 2)
 
 I tried to implement the CSS checkbox hack wihich works but is not pretty. However, all the navigation links are functional, click to try one out!
 
 One thing that worked very well was in my Travel section where the locations appear above the images.
 
One thing is for sure, I will never again question the insensity of CSS!
